# chessKnightMovesBFS
For this project I created a java program that takes a starting position of a knight piece on a chess board and find the shortest path to a destination position. The solution that I built to find the shortest path between the starting position and ending position was to represent the chess board as a graph data structure and use the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting node and the destination node. The search algorithm is the most interesting part of this program since the other parts only exist as something to use the search algorithm for. The search function located in the BFS class uses a queue to search through the graph of squares on the board to find the simplest way of getting from the start square to the destination square. Every node in the graph that gets added to the queue gets added to the visited list to keep track of the path which was taken from the start square to the destination square. Then once the search function gets to the destination square, it reconstructs the path so that it is in the correct order, since the visited list is not in the correct order to display to the user. The output of this program shows the path as coordinates of the chess board, the same format as the user inputted and also identifies how many moves it took the knight to arrive at its destination square from its starting square.
